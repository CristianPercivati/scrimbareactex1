### This was a little exercise from the Scrimba's React Course series (https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) I made a time ago. It's just a simple card, made from React components. It lacks of props or states, so it's pretty basic.

If you want to take a look, just clone the repo and npm install from the directory.
